# Virtual-Mouse-AI-Computer-Vision
Project Overview:

The Virtual Mouse AI Computer Vision project uses advanced computer vision techniques to create a virtual mouse that can be controlled through hand gestures without physical hardware. This project leverages AI and real-time image processing to provide a seamless interaction with your computer using natural hand movements.

How It Works:

The system captures video input from a webcam and uses AI-powered models to detect and track hand gestures. Specific gestures are mapped to mouse actions such as moving the cursor, clicking, and scrolling.

Hand Detection: The AI model detects your hand and key landmarks.
Gesture Recognition: Different finger positions and movements are identified.
Cursor Control: Recognized gestures control the cursor movement on the screen.
Click Simulation: Pinching or specific finger gestures simulate mouse clicks.
Smooth Interaction: Filters and calibration improve smoothness and accuracy.

Unique Features:

Hardware-Free: No need for physical mouse or additional devices.
Real-Time Processing: Instant feedback with minimal delay.
Accurate Gesture Recognition: Robust AI model differentiates complex hand gestures.
Cross-Platform Compatible: Can be adapted for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Lightweight and Efficient: Runs smoothly on average hardware.

Module Breakdown:

1. Video Capture Module
Uses OpenCV to access the webcam.
Continuously captures frames for processing.

2. Hand Detection Module
Integrates AI models (e.g., MediaPipe Hands or custom-trained models).
Identifies the position of the hand and key points (fingertips, joints).

3. Gesture Recognition Module
Analyzes hand landmarks to recognize specific gestures.
Maps these gestures to mouse events like click, double-click, and drag.

4. Cursor Control Module
Converts recognized gestures into mouse movements.
Smooths movement to avoid jitter using algorithms like moving average or Kalman filter.

5. Click Simulation Module
Detects finger pinching or other defined gestures.
Simulates mouse click events using system libraries.

Installation & Setup:

Prerequisites-
Python 3.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe (or other AI frameworks)
NumPy
PyAutoGUI (for mouse control)

Installation:

git clone https://github.com/SUHAANII/Virtual-Mouse-AI-Computer-Vision.git
cd Virtual-Mouse-AI-Computer-Vision
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Project:  python virtual_mouse.py

Usage:
Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.
Run the script.
Use your hand in front of the webcam to control the mouse cursor.

Specific gestures:
Index finger up: Move cursor.
Pinch between thumb and index finger: Left click.
Two fingers up: Scroll.
(Customize the gestures based on your actual implementation.)

Future Improvements:
Adding support for multi-touch gestures.
Improving gesture recognition accuracy in low-light conditions.
Adding voice control integration.
Making it usable on mobile devices.
